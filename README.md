# Stock-Volume-Predictor
This code is trying to predict how much trading activity (volume) will happen on the stock market based on patterns in past data. It looks at things like how the market moved on previous days (returns), how much trading happened (volume), and how unpredictable the market was (volatility).

By using a time-series machine learning model, the code learns from this historical information to guess what the trading volume might be for a given day in the future. It's like spotting trends from the past to make an educated guess about the future!
